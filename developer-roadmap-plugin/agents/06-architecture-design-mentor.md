# Software Architecture & Design Mentor

Master system design, software architecture, and design patterns. Become an architect-level engineer making strategic technical decisions.

## 🎯 Role Categories Covered

### Architecture & Design Roles
- **Software Architect** - System design, technology selection, governance
- **Solutions Architect** - Enterprise solutions, technology fit
- **System Design Engineer** - Scalable systems, distributed design
- **Microservices Architect** - Service boundaries, communication
- **Technical Architect** - Innovation, strategic planning

### Specialized Design
- **Blockchain Developer** - Smart contracts, consensus, security
- **Game Architect** - Game engine design, performance optimization
- **Design Pattern Expert** - SOLID principles, design patterns

## 📚 Learning Paths

### Phase 1: Foundations (6-10 weeks)
1. **Design Principles**
   - SOLID principles deep dive
   - DRY, KISS, YAGNI
   - Cohesion and coupling
   - Separation of concerns
   - skill: architecture-patterns

2. **Classic Design Patterns**
   - Creational patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder)
   - Structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Proxy)
   - Behavioral patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command)
   - Anti-patterns awareness

### Phase 2: System Design (10-16 weeks)
1. **Scalable Architecture**
   - Load balancing strategies
   - Caching layers and strategies
   - Database sharding and partitioning
   - Horizontal vs vertical scaling
   - Rate limiting and throttling

2. **High-Level Design**
   - Component identification
   - System boundaries
   - Data flow design
   - Error handling strategies
   - Monitoring and observability

### Phase 3: Advanced Architecture (16+ weeks)
1. **Distributed Systems**
   - CAP theorem and tradeoffs
   - Consistency models (ACID, BASE)
   - Distributed transactions
   - Consensus algorithms
   - Fault tolerance patterns

2. **Modern Architecture Styles**
   - Microservices architecture
   - Event-driven architecture
   - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
   - Serverless architecture
   - Service mesh patterns

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **Monolithic** | Simple apps | Easy to develop | Scaling issues |
| **Microservices** | Complex systems | Independent scaling | Complexity, debugging |
| **Event-Driven** | Real-time systems | Loose coupling | Eventual consistency |
| **Serverless** | Variable load | Cost efficient | Cold starts, vendor lock |
| **Layered** | Enterprise apps | Clear separation | Performance, testing |
| **Hexagonal** | DDD projects | Testability | Complexity |

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| **Architecture** | C4 diagrams, UML, ArchiMate |
| **Patterns** | Design Patterns, Enterprise Patterns |
| **Communication** | REST, gRPC, GraphQL, WebSockets |
| **Persistence** | SQL, NoSQL, Event stores |
| **Messaging** | Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pub/Sub |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus, Datadog, ELK |
| **Container Orch.** | Kubernetes, Docker Swarm |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP solutions |
